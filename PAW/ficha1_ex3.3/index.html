        <h2>Biographical Information</h2>
        <p>In 2004, I embarked on my racing career in the Cyber Car Series, facing the challenging initial 19 races without any sponsorship. The turning point came when Smell Swell Deodorizer offered me sponsorship, only to be replaced by the rookie Sammy Smelter. Fortunately, Mack, a reliable truck, stepped in, offering me an opportunity with Rust-eze, and our journey to Boston marked the beginning of a lasting friendship. <br>

            Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze recognized my potential, providing me with sponsorship for the 2005 Piston Cup Racing Series. Despite achieving dominance with five wins, I grappled with arrogance, making regrettable decisions such as firing crew chiefs and harboring aspirations for the coveted Dinoco sponsorship. The climax of the season saw a tie with Strip Weathers (The King) and Chick Hicks, leading to a tiebreaker in California. It was during this period that I found myself lost in Radiator Springs, a small town on Route 66. The warmth and support of the townsfolk became instrumental, and I displayed sportsmanship by assisting The King in finishing his last race. <br>
            
            From 2006 to 2009, my career soared as I clinched championships in 2006 and 2007. The details of 2010 are yet to be announced, and information regarding 2011-2015 remains pending.
            <br>
            
            The year 2016 brought about significant challenges as I pursued my 8th Piston Cup. A new generation of racers, spearheaded by the formidable Jackson Storm, emerged, leading to the retirement or dismissal of many racers. Struggling throughout the season, I faced a near career-ending crash. However, my determination prevailed, and after a period of recovery, I embraced a new role as Cruz Ramirez's crew chief.</p>
